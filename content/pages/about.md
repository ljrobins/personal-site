I am a current first year PhD student in Aeronautics and Astronautics at Purdue University. I completed my BS in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering (AAE) at Purdue in 2022, and my MS in AAE in 2023.

I have worked as an intern at [Analytical Graphics, Inc](https://www.agi.com), [Katalyst Space Technologies](https://www.katalystspace.com), and [The Aerospace Corporation](https://aerospace.org). More recently, I spent the summer of 2024 doing research with the optical astronomy group of the [Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern](https://www.aiub.unibe.ch/index_eng.html).

I co-founded and run [Boilerexams](https://boilerexams.com), a website that collaborates with professors at Purdue to provide a studying interface for past exams in a variety of STEM departments. Boilerexams is used by thousands of Purdue students every semester.
